        <h2>Contrast in Shanghai</h2>

        <p class="photos_intro"> Shanghai is one of the most modernized metropolises in the world. However, when people walk around the city center of Shanghai, they could also see that it comprises history and vast changes that have happened since the last century. Just a few streets and blocks away from the modernized city center, lie some old and historic buildings, among which memories and lifestyles from the last century hidden, or to be forgotten...</p>

              This picture is taken in an old alley of Shanghai near Laoximen. The alley is built in the beginning of the 20th century and was renovated several times since then. Soon, it is going to be torn down and the place is going to be redesigned for other purposes. The road is already blocked almost everywhere and nobody lives here anymore. Beyond the end of the road, a few newly built housing estates stand, which contrasts with these unused houses where Shanghai citizens used to live many years ago.

              This picture is taken in an old alley in Shanghai near Laoximen. The alley is planned to be demolished in a few years. From the alley, we could see tangled wires, poles reached out from windows for hanging clothes and some modern buildings beyond the alley.

              This picture is taken around Yu Garden in the old town of Shanghai. The place is not far away from the prosperous city center of Shanghai with modern skyscrapers and was the birthplace of Shanghai history. The area with these historic buildings which used to accommodate many local Shanghai citizens are now regenerated into an commercial area among skyscrapers for sightseeing purpose.

          <p class="mix image4">
              This picture is also taken in an old alley of Shanghai near Laoximen which is already in the process of demolition. In front of an old building, there are some messy electric wires. The whole place seems dead and lifeless. However, there are some green leaves on the wires. The newly grown leaves cling to the support they could get tightly and make me feel hope for new life in an early spring among these ruins.
